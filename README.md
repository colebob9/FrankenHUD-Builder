# FrankenHUD-Builder
A batch script to compile the TF2 HUD [FrankenHUD](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/frankenhud) from source.

Go download a [release](https://github.com/colebob9/FrankenHUD-Builder/releases)! All you need is in that .zip file!

Simply run `compiler.bat` to compile the HUD. You will find the compiled version in the `build` folder as if you were to download a HUD release.

**Note: Make sure to run FrankenHUD-Builder in its directory (folder). The script is programmed to delete files with certain file extensions and may delete something unintentionally if ran somewhere else.**
